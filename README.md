# Cloud Cache Examples

This repo contains examples of apps that demonstrate the use of
Pivotal Cloud Cache.

Local development of an app followed by testing with Cloud Cache
service instances is an efficient way to work.
A local development environment needs a stand in for the Cloud
Cache service instance.  
A Pivotal GemFire cluster works well.

Each example app resides in its own directory within this repository:

- Hello, World! in `hello-world`
